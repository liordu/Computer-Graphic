            <exercise prefix="Basic Exercises" title="Render Engines - Unity" points=10>
                <p>
                    This exercise sheet revolves around Unity as an example of a render engine.
                    Using render engines, you can quickly prototype both 2D and 3D programs using their powerful in-built properties such as physics engine, lighting and behavior through simple scripting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For both Basic and Advanced part, we want you to program a little game from scratch – with Unity, this is easier than one might expect.
                    If you only do the Basic part, the game will not be complete, but you can already win/lose it.
                    If you additionally do the Advanced part, the game has all features.
                    We use <b>Unity 2018.3.0f2</b>, which can be <a href="https://unity3d.com/de/get-unity/download/archive">downloaded</a> for free for your own PC.
                    In the CIP-Pool it is already installed and you can use <code>module load unity/2018.3</code> to get access.
                    If you don't have one already, you will need an account and a license which can easily be created following the instructions in the first access and which is free for personal, educational and even commercial use up to a certain income.
                    If you don't want to create an account by all means, feel free to skip this exercise, this exercise is the only one we will need Unity for.
                    However bare in mind, that you will be missing the points and the experience if you do so.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The game consists of a moving circular plane, a ball rolling on it and coins spawning at random locations.
                    The player’s task is to tilt the plane and let the ball roll around to collect as many coins as possible and get as big as possible.
                    Every time the ball collects a coin, it gets bigger, making it easier to collect more coins.
                    A size decay lets it shrink again when no coins are collected.
                    But beware – the game is over when the ball rolls off the plane!
                    In the picture below, you can see a screenshot of Get Big or Die Tryin’.
                    There is also a small reference video in your exercise folder to show you the game in action.

                        <p>
                            Open Unity and create a new Unity ID or login with your existing ID if you already have one.
                            Choose Unity Personal to use Unity free of charge.
                            By clicking "New", create a new project.
                            Call your project “GetBig” and choose a location of your choice for saving.
                            Projects are saved in folders.
                            In the end, you will have to zip the "Assets" folder contained in the project folder and upload it as your solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once you are done, click "Create" to enter your project.
                            Your empty project screen is divided into several windows.
                            In the middle, you see the scene view, so far consisting of only a camera and a directional light.
                            The hierarchy view on the left shows you a synopsis of the current objects in your scene.
                            The most important window is the Inspector on the right.
                            It opens up to let you inspect the properties of an object selected via click.
                            You can select camera or light source to test this.
                            Your newly created scene is saved as "SampleScene".
                            Always make sure you save it in between programming steps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a first step, you need the three objects the game consists of.
                            Every object in Unity belongs to the class GameObject.
                            Unity provides some 3D primitives as pre-built GameObjects.
                            You can create them selecting GameObject $\rightarrow$ 3D Object in the ribbon at the top.
                            Create the following three GameObjects:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                for the ground plane:
                                Create a cylinder object.
                                In the Inspector, set its scale to 10 in x and z direction and 0.1 in y direction to make it a plane.
                                In the Project window on the bottom, create a new material using right click $\rightarrow$ Create $\rightarrow$ Material and call it "GroundMaterial".
                                In the Inspector, set the material's albedo color to red, then drag it onto the ground plane to color it with the new material.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                for the ball:
                                Create a sphere object.
                                Set its scale to 0.5 in all directions and lift it to y=2 either using the position property in the inspector or the green arrow.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                for a coin:
                                Create a cylinder again.
                                This time, scale it to 0.5 in x and z direction and 0.05 in y direction to account for a coin's size.
                                Turn it around the x axis by 90 degree to let it stand rather than lie.
                                Place it somewhere over the ground.
                                Create a new material "CoinMaterial" with yellow albedo and metallic property set to 1, and color the coin with it.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            You can see the three created objects showing up in the hierarchy on the left.
                            Call them "Ground", "Ball" and "Coin" for better overview.
                            When you are done, you can click on the play button at the top to enter game mode.
                            It should look like the image below.
                        </p>
                        <img class="floatRight" src="images/after a.png" width=600>
                    </subtask>

                    <subtask title="Plane Control – Components, Physics and Scripting" points="7">
                        <p>
                            So far, the ball does not follow physics: As you can see, it does not fall onto the plane.
                            For a GameObject to be affected by physics, it has to have a "Rigidbody" component attached to it.
                            In the Inspector, click "Add Component", search for "Rigidbody" and attach the component.
                            In this component, activate gravity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As you can see, the ball still does not fall.
                            This is because the collider for the ground plane is too big.
                            For physics, so-called colliders are used, which are visualized through green lines.
                            As the ground plane was created as a cylinder, it has a capsule collider attached to it (again, as a component).
                            Remove this component by right-clicking on it, add a "Mesh Collider" component and make it convex.
                            Now you can press Play and watch the ball fall.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the plane as well, add a Rigidbody component.
                            In the component's properties, deactivate the influence of gravity.
                            Furthermore, prevent the plane from changing its position using the Rigidbody's constraints.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now it is time to move the plane.
                            Behavior is added through scripts coded in C#.
                            Add a new script as a new component to the plane.
                            Call it "MovePlane" and click "Create and Add".
                            Right-click on the new component and choose "Edit Script".
                            Visual Studio opens up and shows you the newly created class "MovePlane" which inherits from "MonoBehaviour" and has to implement the two functions "Start" and "Update".
                            <code>Start()</code> is executed once at the beginning of the program, <code>Update()</code> is called in a loop every cycle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can get the values for horizontal (A and D or left and right arrow key) and vertical (W and S or up and down arrow key) using
                            <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetAxis.html"> Input.GetAxis</a>.
                            In the CIP, make sure to use WASD rather than the arrow keys to get proper values.
                            As a first step, get the two values for horizontal and vertical movement inside <code>Update()</code> and use
                            <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Debug.Log.html"> Debug.Log</a> to show them on the console (at the bottom
                            of the Unity window) at runtime.
                            The values returned are between -1 and 1.
                            As you will notice, Unity simulates joystick control by interpolating between 0 and -1/1, so you will also receive values in between.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of just printing the horizontal and vertical movement values, you should now use them to add different forces to the ground plane.
                            Unity's physics engine will then take the forces into account and tilt the plane correctly.
                            Use <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForceAtPosition.html"> Rigidbody.AddForceAtPosition</a> to add
                            forces like shown in the image:
                        </p>
                        <img class="floatRight" src="images/forces.png" width=600>
                        <p>
                            You need two <code>AddForceAtPosition</code> statements: One for horizontal (left-right, x direction) and one for vertical (front-back, z direction) tilt.
                            The forces should be applied in a distance of 1 to the center, always facing to the bottom, so the plane is "pressed" down
                            at one side.
                            Use <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.TransformPoint.html">Transform.TransformPoint</a> and
                            <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.TransformDirection.html">Transform.TransformDirection</a> to transform
                            positions/directions relative to the plane to absolute (= world-space) positions/directions.
                            To call <code>AddForceAtPosition</code>, you need the objects Rigidbody component.
                            You can get access to it using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.GetComponent.html">GameObject.GetComponent</a>.
                            Create a private variable of the type Rigidbody, use <code>GetComponent</code> only once in the <code>Start()</code> method
                            and store the result in your newly created variable to have access to it in the <code>Update()</code> method.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You should now be able to tilt the plane and let the ball roll along it.
                            You will notice that the ball is too heavy for the plane - set its mass to 0.1 rather than 1.
                        </p>
                    </subtask>

                    <p>
                        The task of this - rather easy - game is to reach the coin with the ball before it falls off the plane!
                        Of cause, we can make this game more interesting in the Advanced part.
                        Nevertheless, if you want to submit the Basic exercise, you can hand in the zipped Assets folder at this point.

                    <subtask title="Collecting Coins – Triggers and Actions" points="4">
						<p>
							Right now, the ground plane collides with the coin when the two of them meet; 
							this is the default behavior for the colliders attached to GameObjects.
							To use it as a trigger for certain actions instead, check the "Is Trigger" property of the coin's collider.
							Now, both the ball and the ground plane can pass through the coin.
						</p>
						<p>
							In order to use the triggering capability of the coin's collider, attach a new script, this time not to the plane, but to the coin.
							Call it "MoveCoin".
							Additionally to the two predefined functions, add a third function <code>OnTriggerEnter</code> 
							(see <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Collider.OnTriggerEnter.html"> Collider.OnTriggerEnter</a>)
							to the script.
							Use <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Destroy.html"> Object.Destroy</a> to destroy the coin
							once the collider is triggered.
							As you can see, you can make the coin vanish now by touching it with either the plane or the ball.
						</p>
						<p>
							As coins should only be collected by the ball and not the plane, check whether the other collider involved in the collision
							is the one attached to the ball.
							In order to do so, keep a private GameObject reference in the MoveCoin class and set it to the ball object
							using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/GameObject.Find.html">GameObject.Find</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the <code>Update()</code> method, let the coin rotate around the own axis and hover up and down
							to make it look more than a "real" game coin.
							The functions <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Rotate.html">Transform.Rotate</a>, 
							<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.Translate.html">Transform.Translate</a> and 
							<a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Sin.html">Mathf.Sin</a> might come in handy.
						</p>
					</subtask>

					<subtask title="Spawning Coins – Unity Prefabs and Public Attributes" points="5">
						<p>
							Now the coin looks good and behaves correctly, it is time to create more of them!
							It would be seriously annoying to create all of them individually as cylinders, scale them, add material, add behavior...
							The better way is to create a so-called Prefab containing all properties of an object.
							To do so, drag the coin from the hierarchy into the project pane at the bottom.
							You can drag multiple instances of the Coin prefab into your scene. 
							When you start the game, you can see all coins hover, and vanish when touched by the ball.
						</p>
						<p>
							As it is also annoying to drag all the coins onto the screen, you should instantiate the prefab programmatically.
							To do so, add a new script called "SpawnCoins" to the ball.
							In it, write a method to instantiate a new coin using <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Object.Instantiate.html">
							Object.Instantiate</a>.
							The coin should be placed between -4 and 4 in x and z direction and between 0 and 3 in y direction in order to be collectable by the ball.
							For the rotation, use the prefab's original rotation.
						</p>
						<p>
							As you will need the prefab for <code>Instantiate</code>, you will have to keep a GameObject variable holding a reference on it.
							This time, do not use a private variable and initialize it in the <code>Start()</code> method, but declare it public.
							When you do so, you will find a new property to the script in the Inspector. 
							Drag the coin prefab there to give the script access to it.
						</p>
						<p>
							A new coin should be spawned every second. 
							Use <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.InvokeRepeating.html">MonoBehaviour.InvokeRepeating</a> to call your previously defined method once a second.
							Now you can remove all manually created coins as the program will create them automatically.
						</p>
						<p>
							The ball should grow each time it collects a coin, and its size should decay again over time.
							To make this work, change two things:
							<ul>
								<li>
									In the <code>MoveCoin</code> script, increase the ball's scale by 0.1 in all directions every time a coin is collected.
									You will need its <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform-localScale.html"> Transform.localScale</a> 
									property to do so.

									In the <code>SpawnCoins</code> script, use the function which is called every second.
									If the <code>localScale</code> of the ball exceeds 0.5, multiply it with 0.99 to get a decent decay.

						<p>
							Right now, the ball is rather hard to control, and you cannot quite see the distances between ball and coins well.
							To make the game a really good one, there are some finishing touches left:
						</p>
							<ul>
								<li>
									Add some slowing drag (for example, 3) to the ball's Rigidbody component.
									To also slow down the plane's movement, add some angular drag (as its movement is angular), for example 1.
								</li>
								<li>
									Make the light shine orthogonally onto the ground so shadows are cast directly below coins.
								</li>
								<li>
									Change the camera's position and rotation in a way that makes you see the ball better even when the 
									ground plane is strongly tilted.
								</li>
							</ul>
						<p>
							You can also fine tune the game in any other way if you like. 
							Now you can show your coin-eating abilities - how big can you get?

# Computer-Graphic
Here is all the projects form my "Computer Graphic" course in  Friedrich Alexander University in Germany. Due to the fact that I toke the 5 ects version of this course I only had to do the Basic exercises of the course. So all advanced exercises are unfinished.

Open the "index.html" file in each exercises to both see the task needed and the result.

With flat and Gouraud shading the highlight sometimes disappears when it should be there.
This happens when the highlight is not directly hitting the points where lighting is computed, because the rest of the lighting is only interpolated.
With Phong shading however, the light is computed at every point and only the normal is interpolated.
